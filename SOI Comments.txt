Dear Owen Sacco,

Kindly note that the SOI of Colton Sammut with title 'Detecting and Classifying fresh spices using convolutional neural networks' has been reviewed internally together with your feedback. After review, the following outcome was determined and you may proceed to communicate it to the student.

Final Decision: Student may pursue with the research / SOI however some adjustments and refinements may be required. Student is required to re-submit the SOI in October. Please inform student accordingly.

Feedback by Mentor: The main area of study is interesting, however, developing a system that just detects spices is not enough as a research output for a dissertation. Therefore, it is recommended to add more to this study, for example to combine augmented reality with computer vision, not only to detect spices but to add more context once a spice is detected - for example show relationships with other spices and/or show which dishes this spice could be used and/or some info about the spice. Moreover, it is unclear on which platform this system will run and it would be interesting to see this system running on a mobile phone to detect spices using mobile phones cameras.

More changes to the soi:
- More references is required when outlining key literature
- more explanation on the significance of this study
- hypothesis and research questions should be more narrower, specific and clearer
- An explanation of what dataset will be used in this research and how will it be gathered
- An explanation of what research methodology will be used in this research (i.e. qualitative, quantitative or mixed-approach)
- An explanation how the research will be tested and evaluated - for example whether there will be a user study through questionnaires
- Clarification of the anticipated contributions of the study

Additional Remarks to Mentor: Agree with mentor's comments

Thanks for your time.
